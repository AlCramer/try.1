I want to go to the moon

I want to go to the moon after I leave earth

I want to know why she left

I think that to go to Rome would be nice

I think when to leave is unclear

I think that when to leave is unclear

I saw the girl and boy leave

I kissed the girl and the boy left

I kissed her and she left

I gave the apple to the girl

I gave the apple I bought today to the girl

The boy you saw kissed the girl he liked

the girl you met after I left Paris was pretty

the girl that you met was pretty

did the girl leave yet?

did the girl you met leave town?

After you left the ship we saw mermaids

I gave an apple to the girl you met

What did you see after I left

is the girl you saw the one I know

is she pretty

did you go to the store

On the day you left we saw mermaids

On Monday we saw mermaids

The day you left Paris was cold

The day you left we saw mermaids

The day you left the ship we saw mermaids

shedding gallons of tears , until there was a large pool all round her

, half hoping she might find  another key into it

so Alice ventured to taste it

what a curious feeling

It was too hard to see her

i saw the most amazing thing 

that is the most amazing thing I've ever seen

what reason can you think of

what people did you see

I don't know how many people

I don't know how many people you saw

how many people did you see

how many did you see

after you go i'll come too

if you go i'll come too

if you go home i'll come too

I am being eaten by bears

I was eaten by bears

I was struck by an idea

She was striking him

where can you get clams around here

I ain't coming

Don't go there

He's coming

He's been seen around here

It's the worst thing ever

Let's go to town

I shan't go

I won't go

That's all she wrote

I haven't seen her

I'm going to Rome

He's a nice guy

I ain't here

He didn't go

She wasn't coming

"That's nice," she said.

'No it ain't', said Jack.

He's a nice guy

I ain't here

I gave the ring I bought to the girl I met in Rome

I don't know if she's going to Paris

I gave the ring to the girl I met in Rome

I gave an apple to the girl sitting on the bench

I gave the girl sitting on the bench a peach

The girl sitting on the bench is my sister

You disgust me

I was disgusted by your display of pique

We drank the last of the wine

The best of us was not up to the job

It was the best of the ones you bought in Rome

I gave Rosie money

she might find another key into it

I left town yesterday

I gave some girl money

I gave Rosie some money

I saw John's cat

John's cat saw me

I like that 

I don't like that

she ran like the wind

I do not like to think about that kind of thing

I think I like  that kind of thing

Many of us were unhappy

Many of those people hated most of us

is the boy you saw coming 

was he coming

was he coming today

was he angry 

was that guy very angry

was the guy you saw angry

was the guy you saw today angry

was the guy you saw sitting by the door

was the guy you saw today sitting by the door

was the guy sitting by the door

was she the one I met  

was she the one I met today

was that guy the one I met after you left

was the guy you saw the one I met in Paris

was the guy you saw the one I met after you left

is she sitting by the side of the road
