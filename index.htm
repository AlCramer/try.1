<p>
MSP (Minimal Syntax Parser) is an open source parser for
English. It accepts text as input, and produces an XML representation of
the parse tree as output. It's designed to serve as a self contained
component in any NLP (natural language processing) application. The minimal
syntax used to structure the parse tree is suited to both small tasks
(text or speach based user interfaces on mobile platforms) and
large tasks (data mining of very large corpuses).
</p>
<p>
The parser is available in both Python and Java versions,
under the Apache(2) license.
